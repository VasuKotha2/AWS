# Introduction
---------------
* Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
* Its advertised as `infinitely scaling` storage
* Many websites use Amazon s3 as a backbone
* Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well

# Amazon S3 Use Cases
---------------------
* Backup and storage
* Disaster Recovery
* Archive
* Hybrid Cloud Storage (On premise + cloud)
* Application hosting
* Media hosting
* Data lakes & big data analytics
* Software delivery
* Static website

# Amazon S3 buckets
-------------------
* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects(files) in `buckets`
* Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in region

## Naming convention
--------------------
* No uppercase, No underscore
* 3-63 characters long
* Not an IP
* Must start with lowercase letter or number
* Must not start with the prefix xn--, sthree- (or) sthree-configurator
* Must not end with the suffix -s3alias

# Amazon S3 Objects
-------------------
* Objects (files) have a Key
* The key is Full Path: (Where the object is stored is called key)
    * s3://mybucket/my_file.txt
    * s3://mybucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
* The key is composed of prefix + object name
    * s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
* There's no concept of directories within buckets
(although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
* Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/") with Objects

# Amazon S3 security
--------------------
* User based
* IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM 
* Resource-based
    * Bucket policies - bucket wide rules from the s3 console - allows cross account
    * Object Access control list (ACL) - fine grain (can be disabled)
    * Bucket Access control list (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)
* Note: An IAM principal can access an s3 object if 
    * The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
    * AND there's no explicit DENY
* Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
* Redundancy: Having copies of data in various locations
* SPOF(single point of failure): Having one instance to store data
